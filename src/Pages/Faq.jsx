          answer: "Our standard shipping typically takes 5-7 business days within the United States. For international orders, shipping times can vary significantly based on the destination and local customs processes. We aim to process all orders within 1-2 business days from the time of purchase. You'll receive a confirmation email with a tracking number once your order has been dispatched. Please note that during peak seasons or holidays, shipping may be delayed due to high demand.

        },
        {
          question: "How can I track my order?",
          answer: "Once your order has shipped, you will receive an email containing a tracking number and a link to the carrier's website. You can use this number to monitor the status and location of your package. The tracking information may take up to 24 hours to update after the package has been picked up by the carrier. If you encounter any issues with tracking or have not received your tracking number within three business days, please contact our customer support team at support@milkydrip.com with your order number, and we will be happy to assist you. We want to make sure you know exactly where your order is at all times."

The shipping costs will be calculated at checkout based on your location and the weight of your order. Shipping times for international orders can range from 2 to 4 weeks depending on the destination and local customs. We recommend checking with your local customs office for more information on potential fees before placing your order to avoid any surprises."

          question: "How do I find my size?",
          answer: "We provide a detailed sizing chart on each product page to help you find the perfect fit. We recommend measuring yourself and comparing your measurements to our chart. The measurements are provided in both inches and centimeters. Keep in mind that our clothes are designed with a variety of fits, from slim to oversized, and this will be specified in the product description. If you are between sizes, we generally suggest sizing up for a more relaxed fit or down for a more tailored look. If you need personalized assistance, our team is available to help you find your ideal size."

Our garments are crafted from a variety of high-quality, eco-friendly materials, including organic cotton, recycled polyester, and Tencelâ„¢ Lyocell. We meticulously select our fabrics for their comfort, durability, and minimal environmental impact. Each product page lists the specific material composition, so you can make an informed choice. We believe in transparency and want our customers to feel good about what they are wearing, knowing it was made with care for both people and the planet."
        },
        {
          question: "How should I care for my garments?",
          answer: "To ensure your Milky Drip apparel lasts as long as possible, we recommend following the care instructions on the inside tag of each garment. Generally, we advise washing items in cold water with like colors and a gentle detergent. To prevent shrinkage and preserve the integrity of the fabric, it's best to air dry or tumble dry on low heat. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals. Proper care will help maintain the color, shape, and softness of your clothes, ensuring they remain a favorite in your wardrobe for years to come."
